# Rally-Championship
This is a rally championship simulator. A rally championship consisting of a number of different races, teams, drivers, and cars. When any rally season is played (simulated), you get a ranking of the drivers with their time for each race. Based on this time they are awarded points as well as the team they are part of. There is a team title and a driver title for the team/driver with most points in the season.
